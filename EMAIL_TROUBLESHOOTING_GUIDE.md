# 🚨 URGENT: Email Issue Fix Guide

## Current Problem
You're receiving **Supabase default emails** instead of **custom emails with credentials**.

## Quick Fixes (Try in Order)

### Fix 1: Disable Supabase Email Confirmation (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. Find **"Enable email confirmations"**
4. **Turn it OFF**
5. Save settings
6. Test creating a new user

### Fix 2: Test the Custom Email System
1. Run your database setup script again:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, run the entire supabase_email_setup.sql
   ```

2. Create a test user and watch the browser console
3. Look for logs that say:
   ```
   📧 [AdminPanel] SENDING CUSTOM WELCOME EMAIL WITH CREDENTIALS
   ```

4. You should see a popup window with the email preview

### Fix 3: Check Database Tables
Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check if email tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('email_logs', 'email_templates', 'email_queue');

-- Check if email templates exist
SELECT template_type, subject_template FROM email_templates;

-- Check if emails are being queued
SELECT * FROM email_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check email logs
SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## What Should Happen

### After Creating a User:
1. ✅ User is created in auth.users
2. ✅ User is created in admin_users
3. ✅ Custom email is sent/previewed
4. ⚠️ Supabase default email may also be sent (ignore it)

### In Browser Console You Should See:
```
📧 [AdminPanel] SENDING CUSTOM WELCOME EMAIL WITH CREDENTIALS
📧 [AdminPanel] Email: user@example.com
📧 [AdminPanel] Password: [password]
✅ [AdminPanel] CUSTOM WELCOME EMAIL SENT SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### User Should Receive:
- **Custom email** with branded design, credentials, and login link
- (Possibly) Default Supabase email (can be ignored)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If No Custom Email Preview Appears:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `emailService.js` is properly imported
3. Check if Supabase functions are working

### If Database Errors Occur:
1. Re-run the SQL setup script
2. Check RLS policies are correct
3. Verify admin_users table has email_confirmed column

### If Still Not Working:
1. Disable email confirmation in Supabase (Fix 1 above)
2. Create a test user
3. Check browser console logs
4. Open browser dev tools → Network tab to see any failed requests

## Expected Email Content

The custom email should contain:
```
🏥 Welcome to Elith Pharmacy!

Hello [Name]!

🔐 Your Login Credentials:
📧 Email: user@example.com
🔑 Password: [actual password]
👤 Role: [role]
📅 Account Created: [date]

[Login Button → Direct link to your site]
```

## Quick Test
Create a user and look for this popup message:
> "📧 Custom Email Ready! Click OK to preview the email content in a new window for testing purposes."

If you see this popup, the system is working! Click OK to see the custom email with credentials.

---
**Status**: Custom email system is implemented and should be working
**Next**: Test user creation and check console logs
