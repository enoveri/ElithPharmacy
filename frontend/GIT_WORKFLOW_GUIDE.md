## üåü Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code. Always stable and deployable.
- **`develop`** (optional) - Integration branch for features (if using GitFlow)

### Feature Branches
- **Naming Convention**: `feature/feature-name` or `feature/issue-number-description`
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/edit-product`
  - `feature/categories`
  - `feature/user-authentication`
  - `feature/123-inventory-dashboard`

### Other Branch Types
- **`hotfix/`** - Critical fixes for production
- **`bugfix/`** - Non-critical bug fixes
- **`refactor/`** - Code refactoring without new features
- **`docs/`** - Documentation updates

## üöÄ Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Start a New Feature

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Verify you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current
```

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Make your changes
# ... code, code, code ...

# Stage your changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add src/pages/EditProduct.jsx
git add src/components/NewComponent.jsx

# Check what will be committed
git status
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new feature: brief description

- Detailed point 1
- Detailed point 2
- Fixes issue #123"
```

### 4. Push Your Feature Branch

```bash
# Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# If it's your first push of this branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Merge to Main (Direct Merge)

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push updated main
git push origin main
```

### 6. Clean Up and Start Next Feature

```bash
# Delete local feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete remote feature branch (optional)
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name

# Create next feature branch
git checkout -b feature/next-feature-name
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```
Type: Brief description (50 chars or less)

Detailed explanation of what and why (if needed):
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

Closes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples of Good Commit Messages

git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main
```

### Collaboration Commands

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
```

#### 2. Accidental Commits to Main
```bash
# Move last commit to a new branch
git branch feature/accidental-work
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git checkout feature/accidental-work
```

#### 3. Forgot to Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Move uncommitted changes to new branch
git stash
git checkout -b feature/new-branch
git stash pop
```

#### 4. Need to Update Feature Branch with Latest Main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase main
# or
git merge main
```

#### 5. Wrong Commit Message
```bash
# Amend last commit message
git commit --amend -m "corrected commit message"

# Only if you haven't pushed yet!
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Always work on feature branches
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Pull latest main before creating new branches
- Test your changes before committing
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document breaking changes

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't commit directly to main
- Don't commit broken code
- Don't use generic commit messages like "fix stuff"
- Don't commit large binary files
- Don't force push to shared branches
- Don't leave commented-out code

## üìã Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser
